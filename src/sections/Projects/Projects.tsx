                            An open-source web component library that adheres to Trimble's Modus
                            design system. This library was built using Stencil.js, a web component
                            development toolchain. Although these components are framework agnostic,
                            this project outputs companion libraries for specific frameworks as
                            well.

                            This site! I built this using the Preact CLI. Its code is hosted on
                            GitHub (which you can go check out), and automatically deployed using
                            Netlify. This started as a quick project to help me learn what Preact
                            was like but slowly turned into something I wanted to polish and put
                            out.
